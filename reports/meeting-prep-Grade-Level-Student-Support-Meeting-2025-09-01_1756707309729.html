Child: Sonia M.	Observer: ZHL Team	_________

Age:   12 years	 					Observation Date: __01-12-2022______

The Secondary Screening Instrument for Targeting Educational Risk is a SCREENING TOOL ONLY. The primary goal of this tool is to identify those children who may be at-risk and who merit further observation and investigation. Analysis has revealed that two factors, expressive communication and socially appropriate behavior, discriminate children who are normal from those who are at-risk. If a child is found to be at- risk then the student support team is encouraged to calculate the total score in each of the five content areas. Analysis of the content area score may assist in developing a profile of the child's strengths and special needs. The profile may prove beneficial in determining appropriate areas for evaluation and developing an individual program for the child. Any student failing this screening in a content area as should be considered for educational accommodations or services specific to improving the student’s access to instruction and success in the regular classroom.

ZHL CONSULTING TEAM COMMENTS: (During the observation period did the child have any health or other concerns?) (Based on all available information including the results of this screen, can services be provided in school to support this student? Will a psycho-educational assessment be needed to make a final decision on enrolment or for the development of an individual education plan?)

PREACADEMICS – Marginal

Sonia’s general foundation skills (i.e., reading -level) compared to the difficulty of work expected in class, her ability to summarize and draw conclusions about information, and her demonstration of academic skill growth compared to class peers and teacher expectations are average. 

ATTENTION – Pass 

When called upon and asked a question, Sonia appears to have been attending to teacher instruction, (she appears to understand the basis of the question). Her ability to avoid distraction by noises, visual distractions, personal items, or activities unrelated to class instruction are average. Her attention to detail compared to class peers and teacher expectations (avoiding careless mistakes) is also in the average range.

COMMUNICATION – Marginal

Sonia’s ability to communicate her needs to the teacher, her word usage skills (i.e., written, verbal, signed vocabulary), and her ability to assimilate teacher instruction (presented verbally or visually) in comparison to class peers and teacher expectations are all in average range.

CLASS PARTICIPATION – Marginal

In comparison to her class peers, Sonia’s level of meaningful contribution to classroom discussions, and understanding that  participation is an integral part of the learning process is estimated as average. 
During cooperative group activities, Sonia’s ability to  interact with others to achieve the goals of group work are low average.  This could be because she is still new to the school and her classmates.

SOCIAL BEHAVIOR – Marginal

Sonia frequently demonstrated respectful behavior toward others in class (peers and teacher) and she often followed classroom rules compared to  class peers and teacher expectations. Sonia appears to be accepted by her   peers. There is every indication that this will improve as she becomes more settled in her new school environment.

EXPRESSIVE COMMUNICATION – Pass

Based on the observation, Sonia is attentive and appeared to have been attending to teacher instruction. She was able to avoid distraction by noises, visual distractions, personal items, or activities unrelated to class instruction are average, and pays attention to detail compared to class peers and teacher expectations. Sonia demonstrates respectful behavior toward others in class. 

SOCIALLY APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR – Pass

Based on the observation, Sonia is able to communicate her needs to the  teacher, her word usage skills and her ability to assimilate  teacher instruction in comparison to class peers and teacher expectations are all in average range. Sonia has good participation and contributes to classroom discussions. 

LANGUAGE BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in language behaviors.  (i.e. pronoun reversal, gesturing for desired objects, repeating sounds and words over and over, echoing questions or statements made by other, etc.)



BODY AND OBJECT USE BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in body and object use behaviors. (i.e. flapping of hands, walking on toes, hurting herself by banging her head or biting her hands, etc.)

SENSORY BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in sensory behaviors.  (i.e. poor visual discrimination, seemingly not able to hear, covering ears at sounds, squinting or covering of eyes, staring into space for long periods of time, etc.)

RELATING BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to at times actively avoid eye contact.  There are no other visible deficits in relating behaviors.















ZHL TEAM INTERVIEW:

Sonia was introduced to the ZHL Team by the Head of School.  Sonia entered the room confidently, her physical features appeared normal and her gait was normal. Sonia appeared at her stated age and was appropriately dressed in school uniform and for the weather. Sonia did not wear glasses or have a hearing aid; her psychomotor speed was average and she had an easy rapport. Sonia spoke quietly but loud enough to be heard and understood, and her attitude was comfortable. Her affect was a bit flat but was pleasant and cooperative. Sonia understood the purpose of the interview and gave adequate attention to the process. There were no unusual behaviors observed. Sonia exhibited no signs of hyperactivity, inattention or distractibility; she was able to attentively listen to questions posed to her and respond appropriately without prompts or repetition.

TEACHER OBSERVATONS:

Teachers used two forms to observe Sonia, “The Detailed Checklist of Symptoms” and “The Learning Ability” questionnaires. There were no significate indications of concern reported. 

ZHL CONSULTING TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS:

Based on the information gathered in this observation, Sonia is performing well in her adjustment to her QAIS school environment. There was no visible indication of ADHD. An Individual Education Plan (I.E.P.) will be developed to support her diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With Impairment in Reading (word reading accuracy, reading rate), and Specific Learning Disorder With impairment in written expression (spelling accuracy).  The I.E.P. will include an appendix of research-supported accommodations and instructional strategies for teachers and outside tutors. Her last psychoeducational assessment was over two years old. A full psychoeducational assessment that will offer an updated diagnosis will be needed upon entering grade 9 so that she may possibly apply for exam accommodations.

The Secondary Screening Instrument for Targeting Educational Risk is a SCREENING TOOL ONLY. The primary goal of this tool is to identify those children who may be at-risk and who merit further observation and investigation. Analysis has revealed that two factors, expressive communication and socially appropriate behavior, discriminate children who are normal from those who are at-risk. If a child is found to be at- risk then the student support team is encouraged to calculate the total score in each of the five content areas. Analysis of the content area score may assist in developing a profile of the child's strengths and special needs. The profile may prove beneficial in determining appropriate areas for evaluation and developing an individual program for the child. Any student failing this screening in a content area as should be considered for educational accommodations or services specific to improving the student’s access to instruction and success in the regular classroom.

ZHL CONSULTING TEAM COMMENTS: (During the observation period did the child have any health or other concerns?) (Based on all available information including the results of this screen, can services be provided in school to support this student? Will a psycho-educational assessment be needed to make a final decision on enrolment or for the development of an individual education plan?)

PREACADEMICS – Marginal

Sonia’s general foundation skills (i.e., reading -level) compared to the difficulty of work expected in class, her ability to summarize and draw conclusions about information, and her demonstration of academic skill growth compared to class peers and teacher expectations are average. 

ATTENTION – Pass 

When called upon and asked a question, Sonia appears to have been attending to teacher instruction, (she appears to understand the basis of the question). Her ability to avoid distraction by noises, visual distractions, personal items, or activities unrelated to class instruction are average. Her attention to detail compared to class peers and teacher expectations (avoiding careless mistakes) is also in the average range.

COMMUNICATION – Marginal

Sonia’s ability to communicate her needs to the teacher, her word usage skills (i.e., written, verbal, signed vocabulary), and her ability to assimilate teacher instruction (presented verbally or visually) in comparison to class peers and teacher expectations are all in average range.

CLASS PARTICIPATION – Marginal

In comparison to her class peers, Sonia’s level of meaningful contribution to classroom discussions, and understanding that  participation is an integral part of the learning process is estimated as average. 
During cooperative group activities, Sonia’s ability to  interact with others to achieve the goals of group work are low average.  This could be because she is still new to the school and her classmates.

SOCIAL BEHAVIOR – Marginal

Sonia frequently demonstrated respectful behavior toward others in class (peers and teacher) and she often followed classroom rules compared to  class peers and teacher expectations. Sonia appears to be accepted by her   peers. There is every indication that this will improve as she becomes more settled in her new school environment.

EXPRESSIVE COMMUNICATION – Pass

She was able to avoid distraction by noises, visual distractions, personal items, or activities unrelated to class instruction are average, and pays attention to detail compared to class peers and teacher expectations. Sonia demonstrates respectful behavior toward others in class. 

SOCIALLY APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR – Pass

Based on the observation, Sonia is able to communicate her needs to the  teacher, her word usage skills and her ability to assimilate  teacher instruction in comparison to class peers and teacher expectations are all in average range.

LANGUAGE BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in language behaviors.  (i.e. pronoun reversal, gesturing for desired objects, repeating sounds and words over and over, echoing questions or statements made by other, etc.)



BODY AND OBJECT USE BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in body and object use behaviors. (i.e. flapping of hands, walking on toes, hurting herself by banging her head or biting her hands, etc.)

SENSORY BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to have no visible deficits in sensory behaviors.  (i.e. poor visual discrimination, seemingly not able to hear, covering ears at sounds, squinting or covering of eyes, staring into space for long periods of time, etc.)

RELATING BEHAVIORS:

Sonia was observed to at times actively avoid eye contact.  There are no other visible deficits in relating behaviors.















ZHL TEAM INTERVIEW:

Sonia was introduced to the ZHL Team by the Head of School.  Sonia entered the room confidently, her physical features appeared normal and her gait was normal. Sonia appeared at her stated age and was appropriately dressed in school uniform and for the weather. Sonia did not wear glasses or have a hearing aid; her psychomotor speed was average and she had an easy rapport. Sonia spoke quietly but loud enough to be heard and understood, and her attitude was comfortable. Her affect was a bit flat but was pleasant and cooperative. Sonia understood the purpose of the interview and gave adequate attention to the process. There were no unusual behaviors observed. Sonia exhibited no signs of hyperactivity, inattention or distractibility; she was able to attentively listen to questions posed to her and respond appropriately without prompts or repetition.

TEACHER OBSERVATONS:

Teachers used two forms to observe Sonia, “The Detailed Checklist of Symptoms” and “The Learning Ability” questionnaires. There were no significate indications of concern reported. 

ZHL CONSULTING TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS:

Based on the information gathered in this observation, Sonia is performing well in her adjustment to her QAIS school environment. There was no visible indication of ADHD. An Individual Education Plan (I.E.P.) will be developed to support her diagnosis of Specific Learning Disorder, With Impairment in Reading (word reading accuracy, reading rate), and Specific Learning Disorder With impairment in written expression (spelling accuracy).  The I.E.P. will include an appendix of research-supported accommodations and instructional strategies for teachers and outside tutors. Her last psychoeducational assessment was over two years old. A full psychoeducational assessment that will offer an updated diagnosis will be needed upon entering grade 9 so that she may possibly apply for exam accommodations.
