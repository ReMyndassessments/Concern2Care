Based on the ${req.severityLevel} level concerns related to ${concernTypes} for ${req.studentFirstName} ${req.studentLastInitial}. (Grade ${req.grade}), the following Tier 2 interventions are recommended to address the observed challenges in ${req.location}.

## Immediate Interventions (1-2 weeks)

**1. Structured Check-In System**
- Implementation: Daily 2-minute check-ins at the beginning of class
- Expected outcomes: Improved communication and early identification of issues

- Materials needed: Simple check-in form or digital tool

**2. Clear Expectations and Visual Supports**
- Implementation: Create visual schedule and behavior expectations chart
- Expected outcomes: Increased understanding of classroom routines
- Timeline: Implement within 3 days
- Materials needed: Poster board, markers, laminator

## Short-term Strategies (2-6 weeks)

**3. Targeted Skill Building**
- Implementation: 15-minute focused sessions 3x per week
- Expected outcomes: Improvement in specific skill areas
- Timeline: 4-6 week intervention cycle
- Materials needed: Skill-specific worksheets and manipulatives

**4. Peer Support System**
- Implementation: Pair student with trained peer mentor
- Expected outcomes: Improved social skills and academic support
- Timeline: 4 weeks with weekly check-ins

- Monthly team meetings to assess progress
- Use of standardized assessment tools as appropriate

## When to Escalate

Consider referring to the student support team if:
- No improvement after 4-6 weeks of consistent intervention
- Behaviors escalate in frequency or intensity
- Student expresses safety concerns
- Additional assessment needs are identified
- Family requests formal evaluation

**Note:** This is a demonstration of AI-generated recommendations. In a real implementation, these would be more detailed and specifically tailored to the exact concerns described.`;

  return `## Direct Answer

Thank you for your question: "${req.specificQuestion}"

Based on your specific implementation question and the original recommendations for ${req.studentFirstName} ${req.studentLastInitial}., here's detailed guidance to help you move forward effectively.

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Preparation (Days 1-2)**
- Gather necessary materials and resources
- Set up physical space if needed
- Prepare any visual aids or tools
- Brief any support staff involved

**Step 2: Introduction (Days 3-5)**
- Introduce the intervention to the student
- Explain expectations clearly
- Model the desired behavior or skill
- Practice together initially

**Step 3: Implementation (Week 2+)**
- Begin consistent daily implementation
- Monitor student response closely
- Adjust approach based on student needs
- Document progress regularly

## Practical Tips

- **Start Small**: Begin with shorter sessions and gradually increase
- **Be Consistent**: Same time, same approach daily
- **Stay Positive**: Focus on effort and improvement, not perfection
- **Involve the Student**: Ask for their input and feedback
- **Communicate**: Keep parents and support team informed

## Resources Needed

- Timer for structured activities
- Data collection sheet or app
- Visual supports (charts, pictures)
- Reinforcement items or activities
- Communication log for home-school connection

## Timeline Considerations

- **Week 1**: Setup and introduction
- **Weeks 2-4**: Full implementation with daily monitoring
- **Week 4**: Mid-point review and adjustments
- **Weeks 5-6**: Continue with any modifications
- **Week 6**: Comprehensive review and next steps

## Troubleshooting

**If the student resists:**
- Check if expectations are too high
- Increase reinforcement frequency
- Involve student in goal-setting

**If no progress is seen:**
- Review implementation fidelity
- Consider environmental factors
- Consult with support team

**If behaviors worsen:**
- Ensure safety first
- Document incidents
- Seek immediate support team consultation

## Progress Monitoring

- Daily: Quick check on target behavior/skill
- Weekly: Review data trends and patterns
- Bi-weekly: Assess overall effectiveness
- Monthly: Comprehensive review with team

**Data to Collect:**
- Frequency of target behavior
- Duration of interventions
- Student engagement level
- Academic performance indicators

## When to Seek Additional Support

Contact your student support team if:
- No improvement after 3-4 weeks of consistent implementation
- Student safety concerns arise
- Behaviors escalate beyond classroom management
- You need additional resources or training
- Family has concerns or questions

**Note:** This is demonstration assistance. In a real implementation, the guidance would be more specifically tailored to your exact question and situation.`;
